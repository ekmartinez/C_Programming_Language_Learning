/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any order) 
and then displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows,
columns, and diagonals:

Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

16 3 2 13
5 10 11 8
9 6 7 12
4 15 14 1

Row sums: 34 34 34 34
Column sums: 34 34 34 34
Diagonal sums: 34 34

If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this example), 
the numbers are said to form a magic square. The magic square shown here appears in a 
1514 engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht DÃ¼rer. (Note that the middle numbers
in the last row give the date of the engraving.)
