/*
 Write a program that prints a one-month calendar. The user specifies the number of days in
the month and the day of the week on which the month begins:

Enter number of days in month: 31
Enter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3

           1 2 3 4 5
    6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 29 30 31

Hint: This program isnâ€™t as hard as it looks. The most important part is a for statement that
uses a variable i to count from 1 to n, where n is the number of days in the month, printing
each value of i. Inside the loop, an if statement tests whether i is the last day in a week; if
so, it prints a new-line character

	int days = 0;
	printf("\n%s", "Enter number of days in month: ");
	scanf("%d", &days);

	scanf("%d", &startDateWeek);

	puts("");

	int dayOfWeek = 0;

	for (size_t b = startDateWeek - 1; b > 0; b--) {

		dayOfWeek++;

	for (size_t c = 1; c <= days; c++) {
