# C Arrays

Arrays are data structures consisting of related data items of the same type. Arrays and structs are “static” entities in that they remain the same size throughout program execution. They may be of automatic storage class and hence created and destroyed each time the blocks in which they’re defined are entered and exited.

An array is a group of contiguous memory locations that all have the same type. To refer to a particular location or element in the array, we specify the array’s name and the position number of the particular element in the array. The first element in every array is the zeroth element (i.e., the one with position number 0).  The position number in square brackets is called the element’s index or subscript. An
index must be an integer or an integer expression. 

For example, the following statement assigns 1000 to array element c[2].

```c
c[2] = 1000;
```

## Defining Arrays

Arrays occupy space in memory. You specify the type of each element and the number of elements each array requires so that the computer may reserve the appropriate amount of memory. The following definition reserves 12 elements for integer array c, which has indices in the range 0–11.

```c
int c[12];
```

## Initializing an Array in a Definition with an Initializer List

The elements of an array can also be initialized when the array is defined by following the definition with an equals sign and braces, {}, containing a comma-separated list of array initializers.

The following example use initializer list to initialize array n:

```c
int n[5] = {32, 27, 64, 18, 95};
```

If there are fewer initializers than elements in the array, the remaining elements are initialized to zero. For example, the elements of an array can been initialized to zero as follows:

```c
int n[10] = {0};
```

This explicitly initializes the first element to zero and initializes the remaining nine elements to zero because there are fewer initializers than there are elements in the array. Arrays are not automatically initialized to zero. You must at least initialize the first element to zero for the remaining elements to be automatically zeroed. Array elements are initialized before program startup for static arrays and at runtime for automatic arrays.

If the array size is omitted from a definition with an initializer list, the number of elements in the array will be the number of elements in the initializer list. 

For example, the following would create a five-element array initialized with the indicated values:

```c
int n[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

## Specifying an Array’s Size with a Symbolic Constant

Consider the following definition:

```c
#define SIZE 5
```

This #define preprocessor directive defines a symbolic constant SIZE whose value is 5. A symbolic constant is an identifier that’s replaced with replacement text by the C preprocessor before the program is compiled. When the program is preprocessed, all occurrences of the symbolic constant SIZE are replaced with the replacement text 5. Using symbolic constants to specify array sizes makes programs more modifiable. As programs get larger, this technique becomes more useful for writing clear, easy to read, maintainable programs—a symbolic constant (like SIZE) is easier to understand than the numeric value 5, which could have different meanings throughout the code.

## Character Arrays

A character array can be initialized using a string literal.

Example:

```c
char string1[] = "first";
```

The above example initializes the elements of array string1 to the individual characters in the string literal "first". In this case, the size of array string1 is determined by the compiler based on the length of the string. The string "first" contains five characters plus a special string-termination character called the `null character`. Thus, array string1 actually contains six elements. The escape sequence representing the null character is '\0'. All strings in C end with this character. A character array representing a string should always be defined large enough to hold the number of characters in the string and the terminating null character.

Because a string is really an array of characters, we can access individual characters in a string directly using array index notation. 

For example: 

```c
char string1[] = "first";
string1[0]
```
is the character 'f' and string1[3] is the character 's'.

We also can input a string directly into a character array from the keyboard using scanf and the conversion specifier %s. 

For example:

```c
char string2[20];
scanf("%19s", string2); // reads a string into string2
printf("%s\n, string2); // prints string2
```


## Static Local Arrays and Automatic Local Arrays

A static local variable exists for the duration of the program but is visible only in the function body. We can apply static to a local array definition so the array is not created and initialized each time the function is called and the array is not destroyed each time the function is exited in the program. This reduces program execution time, particularly for programs with frequently called functions that contain large arrays. Arrays that are static are initialized once at program startup. If you do not explicitly initialize a static array, that array’s elements are initialized to zero by default.

## Passing Arrays to Functions

To pass an array argument to a function, specify the array’s name without any brackets.

```c
int hourlyTemperatures[HOURS_IN_A_DAY];
modifyArray(hourlyTemperatures, HOURS_IN_A_DAY)
```
All arguments in C are passed by value, but C automatically passes arrays to functions by reference, the called functions can modify the element values in the callers’ original arrays. The array’s name evaluates to the address of the array’s first element. Because the starting address of the array is passed, the called function knows precisely where the array is stored. Therefore, when the called function modifies array elements in its function body, it’s modifying the actual elements of the array in their original memory locations.

Passing arrays by reference makes sense for performance reasons. If arrays were passed by value, a copy of each element would be passed. For large, frequently passed arrays, this would be time consuming and would consume storage for the copies of the arrays.

Although entire arrays are passed by reference, individual array elements are passed by value exactly as simple variables are. Such simple single pieces of data (such as individual ints, floats and chars) are called `scalars`.

Here is how you can pass an array to a function:

```c
// Passing Arrays to functions

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define SIZE 3

void array_printer(int arr[], size_t size);

int main(void)

{
	int sample_array[SIZE] = {1, 2, 3}; 
	array_printer(sample_array, SIZE);
	return 0;
}

void array_printer(int arr[], size_t size) {

	for (size_t x = 0; x < size; ++x){
		printf("%d\n", arr[x]);

	}

}

```
There may be situations in your programs in which a function should not be allowed
to modify array elements. C provides the type qualifier const (for “constant”) that can be used to prevent modification of array values in a function.

```c
void immutable_array(const int b[]) {
	b[0] /= 2; //error
	b[1] /= 2; //error
	b[2] /= 2; //error
} 
```

## Multidimensional Arrays

A common use of `multidimensional arrays` is to represent tables of values consisting of information arranged in rows and columns. To identify a particular table element, we must specify two indices: The first (by convention) identifies the element’s row and the second (by convention) identifies the element’s column. Tables or arrays that require two indices to identify a particular element are called `two-dimensional arrays`. `Multidimensional arrays` can have more than two indices.

Multidimensional array can be initialized when it’s defined. 

For example:

```c
int b[2][2] = {{1}, {3, 4}};
```
